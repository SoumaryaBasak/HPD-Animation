# HPD-Animation
This repository contains the codes and output of the HPD animation for the Beta Binomial Model. 
One can run the programe in R and can visualize the process easily. 
This chunk of code also allows you to change the different paratermers for the model to get different posteriors and then their HPD credible sets.
